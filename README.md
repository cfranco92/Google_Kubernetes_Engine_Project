## Introduction to Google Kubernetes Engine
To understand what Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine work for:

1) Bare Metal: They are the physical servers. In addition to managing our application, we must take care of the infrastructure (everything related to Hardware: networks, memory, CPU, etc.) and the operating system (updates, security patches, etc).

2) Virtual Machine: The infrastructure is controlled by a virtualized layer, we do not care more about the physical part of our servers.

3) Containers: Containers are the most optimal operation of our applications. We only care about managing our application and its dependencies (programming languages, frameworks, logs, etc.), while our cloud providers will be in charge of the infrastructure and the operating system.
